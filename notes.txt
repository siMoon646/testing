#include <iostream> is for the input and output

namespaces define a scope -> namespace std is the standard namespace -> specifies location of objects.

String, cout, cin -> all defined within standard namespace
(omitting standard namepsace spec, requires that all objects within the std namespace be pre-fixed with 'std::')

Datatypes:
1) auto -> let the compiler figure out
2) double 
3) bool
4) char
5) size_t -> datatype that represents that represents the size of a datastructure -> !< 0
6) int16/64_t -> 16 bit int or 64 bit int respectively

const (c++) = final (java)

Homogenous contiguous memory

Recall: creating objects with the new keyword will create that object on the heap. C++ allows the creation of
objects on the stack by omititng the 'new' keyword.

If an array is created on the stack, the size of the array must be known before compile time.

Array elements are unitilialized until you initialize them. If you initialize any element(s), the rest are zeroed/null'd

The compiler needs to know declarations -- that things exist.
Linker 'ld' wants:
1) only one main
2) job: "connect things"


Week 3 Day 1: --------------------------------------
Header files: put method declarations inside here and #include them the main cpp file (include "pathToHeaderFile").
can put method definition for the declarations in the header files in a separate cpp file.

# - pre-processor directives -> before the compiler reads these, they are replaced with the content of the files they represent.

String class & Vector class -> two most common classes from the standard library.

In java, assignment of objects, is the assignment of references.
